## Problem #7 :    create a shell script 

- create a shell script named /root/delvex.sh 
- Make sure it will run /bin/sh shell 
- A user will be running this script my using a command name opensource
- When a user  run like  "opensource  time" it must give current time only
- when it runs like "opensource user"  it will give list of interactive shell users only
- When run like "opensource 100"  it must print "Hello Delvex" 100 times in interval of 1 sec
- If runs like  "opensource windows"  then it must shutdown OS
- If run opensource command without any parameter  then it must show out --
             i)   name of kernel 
             ii)   version of kernel 
             iii)  current date in the format of  /DD/MM/YY
             iv)  name of OS 
             v)   last reboot time
